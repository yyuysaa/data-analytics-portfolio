## ‚õ≥ Golf Tournament Score Analysis
- **Tool:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Goal:** Analyze golf tournament data to understand scoring trends and player performance.  
- **Data:** AJGA tournament leaderboard data (scraped/cleaned into structured format).  
- **Steps:**  
  - Cleaned raw scores into structured format (holes, par, strokes).  
  - Computed player averages (per hole, per round).  
  - Identified the toughest/easiest holes based on scoring distribution.  
  - Visualized par performance across different holes and rounds.  

- **Key Findings:**  
  - Par 3 holes tended to be the most challenging.  
  - The back nine showed higher scoring averages than the front nine.  
  - A few standout players consistently performed under par across all rounds.
