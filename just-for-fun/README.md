## ðŸ§© GUI Scrabble Game (C++ / Qt)

One of my recent school projects was creating a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Scrabble game**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Developed in **C++** using the **Qt framework** for GUI design.  
- Implemented a digital version of Scrabble with:
  - Interactive game board.
  - Tile dragging and placement.
  - Automatic score calculation for valid words.
  - Turn-based play for multiple players.

### ðŸ”¹ What I Learned
- Building GUIs in C++ with Qt (layouts, signals/slots, event handling).
- Designing and managing game state with object-oriented programming.
- Handling word validation and scoring logic.
- Connecting backend logic with a user-friendly front end.

### ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements
- Add a single-player mode with AI opponent logic.
- Enhance board visuals (bonus tiles, animations).
- Integrate larger dictionaries for more realistic word play.
- Add save/load functionality for ongoing games.

âœ¨ This project combined my love for games with hands-on experience in GUI programming. It taught me how to bring a classic board game to life through C++ and Qt!
